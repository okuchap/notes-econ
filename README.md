  - Define and analyse GSPA (static, complete info) and GEA (dynamic, incomplete info).
  - GSPA has an envy-free equilibrium that has (1) the same revenue as in VDG, and (2) this eqm has the lowest revenue among EF eqm.
  - GEA has the unique and simple **ex-post eqm**.

- [Charness, Levin (2009, AEJMicro), The Origin of the Winner's Curse: A Laboratory Study](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.1.1.207)
  - The driving force behind the winner's curse is *not* failure to take account of the cognition of other players or beliefs about other players (cf: Cursed Eqm., Level-k), *but* **failure to recognize that a future contingency is relevant for their current decision.**
  - Eyster&Rabin's fully cursed model is well fit to the data.
  - more detailed explanation have some effects.(framing), heterogeniety across the population, little learning over time.

- [Enke, Zimmermann (2017, REStud), Correlation Neglect in Belief Formation](https://academic.oup.com/restud/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/restud/rdx081/4772809)
  - Experimental evidence of "double counting", or correlation neglect.
  - Analyze the steps of reasonings: (1) Notice the problem, (2) Understand how to solve it, (3) Calculation
    - conceptual part: (1) and (2), mathematical part: (3)
  - conceptual complexity (the size of info structure, frame) can meaningfully affect CN.

  - By change of variables, delegation problems can be reduced to online decision making problem.
  - Prophet Inequalities can give the lower bound of principal's payoff in the simple mechanism.

- [Spiegler (2016, QJE), Bayesian Networks and Boundedly Rational Expectations](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/131/3/1243/2461139?redirectedFrom=PDF)
  - Introduce Bayesian Network to the literature on nonrational expectation.
  - DM formulates their subjective belief by fitting their causality model (BN) to the historical data.

- [Spiegler (2017, REStud), “Data Monkeys”: A Procedural Model of Extrapolation from Partial Statistics](https://academic.oup.com/restud/article-abstract/84/4/1818/2929388)
  - Suppose a DM follows some specific behavioral pattern, and derive some condition under which DM's subjective belief can be represented by BN.

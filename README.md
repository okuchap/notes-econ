## Done

**2018-08**
- [Charness, Levin (2009, AEJMicro), The Origin of the Winner's Curse: A Laboratory Study](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.1.1.207)
  - Not failure to take account of the cognition of other players or beliefs about other players, but failure to recognize that a future contingency is relevant for their current decision is the driving force of behind the winner's curse.
  - Eyster&Rabin's fully cursed model is well fit to the data.
  - more detailed explanation have some effects.(framing), heterogeniety across the population, little learning over time.

- [Enke, Zimmermann (2017, REStud), Correlation Neglect in Belief Formation](https://academic.oup.com/restud/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/restud/rdx081/4772809)
  - Experimental evidence of "double counting", or correlation neglect.
  - conceptual complexity (the size of info structure, frame) can meaningfully affect CN.

- [Keller, Rady, Cripps (2004, ECMA), Strategic Experimentation with Exponential Bandits](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1468-0262.2005.00564.x)

  - *[To be written.]*

- [Jon Kleinberg, Robert Kleinberg (2018, EC18), Delegated Search Approximates Efficient Search](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3219205)
  - By change of variables, delegation problems can be reduced to online decision making problem.
  - Prophet Inequalities can give the lower bound of principal's payoff in the simple mechanism.

**2018-07**
- [Spiegler (2016, QJE), Bayesian Networks and Boundedly Rational Expectations](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/131/3/1243/2461139?redirectedFrom=PDF)
  - Introduce Bayesian Network to the literature on nonrational expectation.
  - DM formulates their subjective belief by fitting their causality model (BN) to the historical data.

- [Spiegler (2017, REStud), “Data Monkeys”: A Procedural Model of Extrapolation from Partial Statistics](https://academic.oup.com/restud/article-abstract/84/4/1818/2929388)
  - Suppose a DM follows some specific behavioral pattern, and derive some condition under which DM's subjective belief can be represented by BN.
